# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

Version controls is a system in which changes to a file and the many different versions of it are stored. It is used by developers because as time progresses and they need to revisit another type of file that had different changes to it they can do so because it is stored. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
While you are  in the master branch by default, many other branches can be created while working on a  project separately so that you can later add all the separate files or MERGE them safely together when they work from your different branches. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when you add the newest changes to a file. Some good practices would be to add a message every time you commit so when you look back you can easily tell what change was made.
* What is a merge conflict?
Merge conflict can happen when your trying to intergate or merge another branch of code into the current one .

A merge conflit can happen when you are trying to intergrate diferent files or merge them together. Github usually finds a way to merge them without you getting involved.
