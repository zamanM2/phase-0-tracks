# 1. Iterate through the zombie_apocalypse_supplies array using #each,

# ----

# 2. Create a method to see if a particular item (string) is in the
# zombie_apocalypse_supplies using #each.
# For instance: are boots in your list of supplies?

# 3. You can't carry too many things, you've only got room in your pack for 5.
# Remove items in your zombie_apocalypse_supplies in any way you'd like,
# leaving only 5, using #each.
# ----

# 4. You found another survivor! This means you can combine your supplies.
# Create a new combined supplies list out of your zombie_apocalypse_supplies
# and their supplies below. You should get rid of any duplicate items.
# Find the built-in method that helps you accomplish this in the Ruby
# documentation for Arrays.

# 1. Iterate through extinct_animals hash using #each, printing each key/value pair
# with a dash in between the key and value, and an asterisk between each pair.
# ----

# 2. Keep only animals in extinct_animals if they were extinct before
# the year 2000, using #each.
# ----

# 3. Our calculations were completely off, turns out all of those animals went
# extinct 3 years before the date provided. Update the values in extinct_animals
# using #each, so they accurately reflect what year the animal went extinct.
# ----

# 4. You've heard that the following animals might be extinct, but you're not sure.
# Build a method  using #each that checks if an animal is in the hash and returns true/false.
# Call the method in your driver code with each of the following animals to check if
# they are extinct or not:
# "Andean Cat"
# "Dodo"
# "Saiga Antelope"
# Driver code example: is_extinct?(extinct_animals, "Andean Cat")
# ----

# 5. We just found out that the Passenger Pigeon is actually not extinct!
# Remove them from extinct_animals and return the key value pair as a two item array.
# Find a Ruby Hash built-in method that helps you accomplish this or build
# your own method using #each
